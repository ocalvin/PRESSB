# PRESSB
A program that elicits behavior on discriminated VIVI concurrent schedules, which results in data that is well suited to a matching law analysis.

A correction was published here on 2022-01-24, due to an issue with the behavioral counts it was producing. The .zip file with that date should be used. In addition I uploaded the VB.Net code in case someone would like to edit it to meet their own needs. The older version has been left here for posterity, but it should not be used.
